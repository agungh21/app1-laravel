      <p class="card-text">A school is an institution designed for the teaching of students / pupils under the supervision of teachers. Most countries have a formal education system, which is generally mandatory. In this system, students progress through a series of schools. The names for these schools vary by country (discussed in the Regions section below), but generally include primary schools for young children and secondary schools for youth who have completed primary education. In addition to the core schools, students in certain countries may also have access to and attend schools both before and after primary and secondary education. Kindergartens or pre-schools provide schooling for some very young children (usually 3-5 years of age). Universities, vocational schools, colleges or seminaries may be available after high school. A school may also be dedicated to a particular field, such as an economics school or a dance school. Alternative schools can provide non-traditional curricula and methods. There are also non-government schools, called private schools. Private schools may be for children with special needs when the government cannot provide special schools for them; religious schools, such as Islamic schools, Christian schools, hawzas, yeshivas and others, or schools that have a higher standard of education or seek to develop other personal achievements. Schools for adults include corporate training institutions and military education and training. In homeschooling and online schools, teaching and learning takes place outside the traditional school building.</p>
